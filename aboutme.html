  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p><em>“Run to the rescue with love and peace will follow.”</em></p>
  <p style="text-indent:400px;"> - River
    Phoenix</p>
    <p>Hi! I’m Ryan,</p>
    <p>I am a Mathematics PhD candidate studying at <strong>Claremont
    Graduate University (CGU)</strong> and intending to Graduate in
    <strong>Spring 2025</strong>. I did my undergraduate degree at
    <strong>Linfield University</strong> where I fell in love twice: once
    with my wonderful Fiancée Diana, and once more with mathematics.</p>
    <p>I am a believer in the power of kindness and education to change the
    world. Everything is getting more expensive, but friendliness and
    knowledge are commodities which should always be free.</p>
    <h3>Mathematics</h3>
    <p>I found a love for mathematics during my first analysis course in my
    undergraduate program. Prior to this course I had experienced
    mathematical proofs in some degree through geometry and linear algebra,
    but I credit this course for opening my eyes to the world of proof-based
    mathematics. I simply could not get enough after that.</p>
    <p>Nowadays my research area revolves around the intersection of three
    primary fields of mathematics.</p> 
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Harmonic Analysis</strong>: The
    study of representing complicated functions on some domain by a
    composition of simpler, inter-related, functions.</li>
    <li><strong>Approximation Theory</strong>: The study of errors arising from
    estimating said complicated functions by only some of the constituent
    simple functions.</li> 
    <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> the study of
    adaptive algorithms and tools with the aim to allow machines to “learn”
    about various complicated topics and assist our lives.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Specifically, I am working with my advisor, Professor <a
    href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hfxSUBEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Hrushikesh
    Mhaskar</a>, to leverage ideas from harmonic analysis and approximation
    theory (as well as other fields!) in order to develop rigorous
    mathematical models for machine learning applications. Our work is
    focused on the estimation of unknown, noisy functions on unknown domains
    given finitely many data points sampled from those functions: a prime
    setting for machine learning. We are developing a paradigm that
    simplifies and elucidates the mathematical approach to machine learning
    with the intent to reduce computational training costs and provide more
    mathematical clarity and justification to algorithms. For more detailed
    information, visit my <a href="research.html">Research</a> page!</p> 
    <h3>Personal Life</h3>
    <p>I was born in San Diego, California but spent most of my childhood in
    the sunny plains of Boulder County, Colorado. I am the oldest child in
    my family and have three younger siblings: Tyler, Trevor, and Kelsey.
    Tyler works as a Software Engineer in Laramie Wyoming. Trevor is about
    to graduate from the Citadel, a military school in South Carolina, with
    a degree in criminology. Kelsey is doing her first year of a bachelor’s
    program at Central Methodist University in Missouri, where she plays
    softball. I am extremely proud of, and close with, my siblings.</p>
    <p>In my childhood I did Taekwondo, achieving a black belt by the time I
    was in middle school. outside of school I was constantly playing with
    legos, rubiks cubes, yoyos, and enjoying the now-classic video game
    known as Minecraft. In High School I became interested in math and
    physics, as well as digital art and photography. I went to College at
    Linfield in Mcminnville, Oregon, a small town out in the endless green
    hills of Oregon’s wine country, where I got my Bachelor’s degree in
    Mathematics with minors in physics and studio art (some of my art is
    showcased on my <a href="art.html">Art</a> page). I met my Fiancée at
    Linfield and over the last 6 years we have both been completing
    different graduate programs. We are looking forward to getting married
    and starting our lives together after we both finish school.</p>
    <p>These days when I am not puzzling over mathematics, I can typically
    be found puzzling over board games or sudoku-type puzzles (<a
    href="https://sudokupad.app/gphj7LF93b">here</a> is one of my favorites,
    and <a href="https://sudokupad.app/ksptv65v8k">here</a> is one for those
    looking for a challenge).</p>
    <p>I care deeply about the other inhabitants of Earth we share our world
    with and one of my life’s goals is to help reduce the suffering caused
    to animals by human hands through animal agriculture and factory
    farming. I think many people do not realize how bad it really is for the
    animals whose products we as humans purchase and consume. <a

    it’s man-made, right here on Earth.</p>
