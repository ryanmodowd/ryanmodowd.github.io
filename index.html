  <h3 id="basics">Basics</h3>
  <p>Complex numbers <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{C}\)</span> can
  be represented in two main ways: 1) <span
  class="math inline">\(a+bi\)</span> where <span
  class="math inline">\(a,b\in \mathbb{R}\)</span>, and <span
  class="math inline">\(i=\sqrt{ -1 }\)</span>. 2) <span
  class="math inline">\(re^{i\theta}\)</span>, where <span
  class="math inline">\(r&gt;0\)</span> and <span
  class="math inline">\(\theta\in \mathbb{R}\)</span>. Note that <span
  class="math inline">\(0\)</span> does not have a representation in this
  form. In the second form, one can rewrite <span
  class="math inline">\(e^{i\theta}=\cos\theta+i\sin\theta\)</span>. This
  second form allows us to consider also a complex logarithm, for any
  non-zero <span class="math inline">\(z\in \mathbb{C}\)</span>. We define
  it as <span class="math display">\[
  \log(z)=\log(re^{i\theta}):=\ln(r)+i\theta,
  \]</span> observing that <span
  class="math inline">\(e^{\log(z)}=z\)</span>. Note that for any <span
  class="math inline">\(\Theta\in (-\pi,\pi]\)</span>, <span
  class="math inline">\(e^{i\theta}=e^{i\Theta}\)</span> whenever <span
  class="math inline">\(\theta=\Theta+2\pi n\)</span> for some <span
  class="math inline">\(n\in \mathbb{N}\)</span>. This means <span
  class="math inline">\(\log(z)\)</span> is only a one-way inverse, and it
  is actually a multi-valued function since the choice of <span
  class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> is not unique. As such, one can
  make it single valued by restricting <span
  class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> to <span
  class="math inline">\((-\pi,\pi]\)</span>, known as the <em>principal
  branch</em>. Other domains for <span
  class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> are possible, creating separate
  branches.</p>
  <h3 id="differentiability-and-series-representations">Differentiability
  and series representations</h3>
  <p>We say that a function <span class="math inline">\(f:\mathbb{C}\to
  \mathbb{C}\)</span> is complex differentiable at a point <span
  class="math inline">\(z_{0}\)</span> if <span class="math display">\[
  f(z_{0}):=\lim_{ z \to z_{0} } \frac{f(z)-f(z_{0})}{z-z_{0}}
  \]</span> exists (and is finite). Writing <span
  class="math inline">\(z=a+bi\)</span> then we note that any such
  function <span class="math inline">\(f=g(a,b)+h(a,b)i\)</span>, where
  <span class="math inline">\(g,h\)</span> are real-valued functions. So
  the differentiability formula can be rewritten as <span
  class="math display">\[
  \lim_{ a+bi \to a_{0}+b_{0}i }
  \frac{(g(a,b)-g(a_{0},b_{0}))-(h(a,b)-h(a_{0},b_{0}))i}{(a-a_{0})-(b-b_{0})i}.
  \]</span> For a differentiable function, this formula needs to be path
  independent. Using this fact, one can deduce the <em>Cauchy-Riemann
  equations:</em> <span class="math display">\[
  \frac{dg}{da}=\frac{dh}{db},\qquad -\frac{dg}{db}=\frac{dh}{da},
  \]</span> which are necessarily satisfied by a differentiable function.
  <strong>2022 PM2</strong> These equations holding true on some
  neighborhood around <span class="math inline">\(z_{0}\)</span> is also a
  sufficient condition for differentiability. If a function <span
  class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is differentiable on some neighborhood
  of a point <span class="math inline">\(z_{0}\)</span>, it is said to be
  <em>analytic</em> at that point. Equivalently, functions which are
  analytic at <span class="math inline">\(z_0\)</span> admit local power
  series representations: <span class="math display">\[
  f(z)=\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_{k}(z-z_{0})^k.
  \]</span> Furthermore, we have the following theorem:  Laurent’s
  Theorem: — If <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is analytic on a
  domain <span class="math inline">\(R_{1}&lt;|z-z_{0}|&lt;R_{2}\)</span>
  for <span class="math inline">\(0&lt;R_{1}&lt;R_{2}\in
  \mathbb{R}\)</span> and <span
  class="math inline">\(z_0\in\mathbb{C}\)</span>, then for each point in
  this domain, <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> can be uniquely
  representation by <span class="math display">\[
  f(z)=\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty c_{n}(z-z_{0})^n,
  \]</span> where, for any simple positively-oriented closed contour
  (SPOCC) <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span>, <span
  class="math display">\[
  c_{n}=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\Gamma}\frac{f(z)}{(z-z_{0})^{n+1}}dz.
  \]</span> — <strong>2023 PM6</strong>  Integrals and singular
  points</p>
  <p>A point <span class="math inline">\(z_0\)</span> is called a(n)
  (isolated) <em>singular point</em> of a function <span
  class="math inline">\(f\)</span> if the function is analytic for every
  point in some neighborhood of <span class="math inline">\(z_0\)</span>,
  but not analytic on <span class="math inline">\(z_0\)</span>.</p>

  <hr />
  <p>Parking garage analogy: taking a loop around a single level of a
  parking garage is like integrating over an analytic function. Maybe you
  have some up and downs from speed bumps, but you end up back at the same
  height you started. Taking a loop up a spiral to the next level is like
  integrating around a singular point. You end up in the same position but
  on a higher level (or function value, corresponding to the floor).</p>
  <p>There are three major types of singular points to consider: -
  <em>Essential</em> singularities, where infinitely many of the
  coefficients <span class="math inline">\(c_{n}\)</span> are non-zero for
  <span class="math inline">\(n&lt;0\)</span>, - <em>Removable</em>
  singularities, where every <span class="math inline">\(c_n=0\)</span>
  for <span class="math inline">\(n&lt;0\)</span> and the pole can be
  “filled in” with the right value of <span
  class="math inline">\(f(z_0)\)</span> in order to make the function
  analytic at <span class="math inline">\(z_0\)</span>, and -
  <em>Poles</em> of order <span
  class="math inline">\(m\in\mathbb{N}\)</span>, where <span
  class="math inline">\(c_{n}\)</span> may be non-zero only when <span
  class="math inline">\(n&gt;-m\)</span>.</p>
  <p>If <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> has a pole of order <span
  class="math inline">\(m\)</span> at <span
  class="math inline">\(z_0\)</span>, then <span class="math display">\[
  f(z)=\frac{g(z)}{(z-z_{0})^m},
  \]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(g(z)\)</span> is analytic at
  <span class="math inline">\(z_{0}\)</span>. The residue is then: <span
  class="math display">\[
  \underset{z=z_{0}}{\operatorname{Res}}f(z)=\lim_{ z \to z_{0} }
  \frac{1}{(m-1)!}\frac{d}{dz}\left(f(z)(z-z_{0})^m\right)=\frac{g^{(m-1)}(z_{0})}{(m-1)!}.
  \]</span>  Theorem: If <span class="math inline">\(p,q\)</span> are
  analytic at <span class="math inline">\(z_0\)</span>, <span
  class="math inline">\(p(z_0),q(z_{0})\)</span> are non-zero, but
  <span class="math inline">\(q(z_{0})=0\)</span>, then <span
  class="math inline">\(z_{0}\)</span> is a simple pole of <span
  class="math inline">\(p(z)/q(z)\)</span> and <span
  class="math display">\[
  \underset{z=z_{0}}{\operatorname{Res}
  }\frac{p(z)}{q(z)}=\frac{p(z_{0})}{q(z_{0})}.
